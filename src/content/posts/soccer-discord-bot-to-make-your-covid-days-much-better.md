During the legendary (and nightmare) Covid days, my life is stuck around studying online, and depression. Luckily, there was Discord and my friends âœ¨. Talking and playing games with my friends was so fun, and Discord seems to be my most frequently used app during those tough times.

Then, out of curiosity, we found out about Discord bots, especially the Game Discord Bots, that we can play games using them. But unfortunately, our favourite games-soccer games- weren't available on the Discord bots at the time.

After a while searching on Google, I found out that you can create your own Discord Bot using Python. So using my 1 year experience in Python, I quickly learned to code and deploy it using repl.it. I then gradually developed the bot, add our favourite games like: "Guess the player", "Missing 11", "Soccer Quiz", etc.

This project is my personal favorite, as it brings me direct joy, and I was able to use it to benefit me and my friends, during one of the most depressing time for everyone.
