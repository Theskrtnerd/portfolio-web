Spotify is becoming one of the most popular applications, and an irreplaceable software on your devices. But its downsize is that it costs money ðŸ™‚. Of course, it's not too expensive, rather cheap for many people. 

But for me, I don't like anything that is billed automatically in my bank account, and it's always better to use something that has the same functionalities and is cheaper, right?

Furthermore, there're songs that I like that are not available on Spotify, which are in other music platforms like Youtube or Soundcloud.

That's when I try to use Youtube Music. Hold on a second, Youtube Music still costs money! Yes, but there's a free version of Youtube Music, which is called Youtube Music Revanced.

With this application, there're so many advantages that can boost the way you listen to music.
