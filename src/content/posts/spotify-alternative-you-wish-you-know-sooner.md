# Introduction

Spotify is becoming one of the most popular applications, and an irreplaceable software on your devices. But its downsize is that it costs money ðŸ™‚. Of course, it's not too expensive, rather cheap for many people.

But for me, I don't like anything that is billed automatically in my bank account, and it's always better to use something that has the same functionalities and is cheaper, right?

Furthermore, there're songs that I like that are not available on Spotify, which are in other music platforms like Youtube or Soundcloud.

That's when I try to use Youtube Music. Hold on a second, Youtube Music still costs money! Yes, but there's a free version of Youtube Music, which is called Youtube Music Revanced.

With this application, there're so many advantages that can boost the way you listen to music.

Some of the advantages are:

* Listen to songs that are only available on Youtube
* Listen to podcasts that are only available on Youtube
* Save data and loading time compared to a traditional Youtube video
* No ads or paying

Still, it has its own downsides:

* Violating Youtube's rules
* Missing a lot of songs
* You have to root your phone if you're using Iphone
