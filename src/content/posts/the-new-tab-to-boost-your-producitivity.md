Override Chromeâ€™s new tab page to create a more personalized browsing experience

I have always felt like my newtab is not beautiful enough, and I could add many features to make it more personalized.

At first I used the Chrome's Nighttab extension. It was pretty good, but the customization took so long to setup, and the features are still limited in my opinion.

In my mind, a perfect newtab will be like a personal dashboard, with my calendar, apps, clock, and interests all in one place. But as this will requires a huge amount of customization, there'll be no free extensions that can fullfill my needs. So the only way is to code it myself
