If you did some Math Olympiads, you probably know about polynomial irreducibility, right? This blog will talk about how I create a Python script to check if a polynomial irreducibility, and give a maths proof to prove the statement.

So in 2022, I had the opportunity to join a Math summer camp with a few of my friends. The camp was really intensive and fun, and I learned a lot of Math Olympiads problems during that enjoyable time. And in one class about polynomial irreducibily, we learned about a few techniques, or criterions to check the irreducibility, including Eisenstein, Cohn, and Perron's criterions. And what's interesting is that, if the polynomial P(x) is irreducible, then the polynomial P(x+n) is also irreducible for some integer n. What this means is that if I can run through all n from -100000 to 100000, I'd have a really high chance to prove the irreducibility using the previous criterions.

With that said, I immediately got into work.

For starters, I created a function ```expandFunction()```

Below is the full code

And for latex, this was the following equations: $$a + \frac{b}{v}$$

This is another inline expression $$n$$ followed by a normal expression, which align to the ___middle___ of the content:

$$
\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}
$$
